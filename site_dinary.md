Often called "The Most Beautiful Woman in Film," Hedy Lamarr's beauty
and screen presence made her one of the most popular actresses of her
day.

She was born Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler on November 9, 1914 in Vienna,
Austria. At 17 years old, Hedy starred in her first film, a German
project called *Geld auf der Strase*. Hedy continued her film career by
working on both German and Czechoslavakian productions. The 1932 German
film *Exstase* brought her to the attention of Hollywood producers, and
she soon signed a contract with MGM.

Once in Hollywood, she officially changed her name to Hedy Lamarr and
starred in her first Hollywood film, *Algiers* (1938), opposite Charles
Boyer. She continued to land parts opposite the most popular and
talented actors of the day, including Spencer Tracy, Clark Gable, and
Jimmy Stewart. Some of her films include an adaptation of John
Steinbeck's *Tortilla Flat* (1942), *White Cargo* (1942), Cecil B.
DeMille's *Samson and Delilah* (1949), and The Female Animal (1957).
