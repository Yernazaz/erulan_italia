# Hedy Lamarr Project

This repository contains a static website that celebrates the life and inventions of Hedy Lamarr. The site uses a layout inspired by the Brodsky heritage project but adopts fonts and colors from **hedylamarr.com**.

All images are stored locally in the `images/` folder so the page works offline. The site includes a brief biography, highlights of Lamarr's film career and inventions, and small datasets demonstrating knowledge organization and representation.

## Local Development
Simply open `index.html` in your browser. The CSS file provides the styling and no additional build step is required.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages
1. Create a repository on GitHub and push these files to the `main` branch.
2. In the repository settings, enable **GitHub Pages** and choose the `main` branch as the source.
3. After a few minutes your site will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>`.
